## What is a CTX?

A Cyber Training Exercise (CTX) is an ROTC training exercise. It is fundamentally about teaching leadership through the cyberspace operations mechanic. If you're in ROTC, you're probably quite familiar with a Field Training Exercise (FTX). In an FTX, the mechanic is ground combat and all it's associated skills (small unit tactics, TCCC, radio commns, etc.). In a CTX, the mechanics include the cyber domain and all it's associated skills (reverse engineering, network scanning, vulnerability assessment, etc.).

> A <abbr title='Cyber Training Exercise'>CTX</abbr> is defined as: an FTX where cyberspace operations replace some of the ground combat mechanics

## Mission / Vision

### Vision:

Think of this as the long term objective, the big picture idea for this project.


> ## *Pioneer the future of Space Force cadet training*


### Mission:

Think of this as the method for achieving the vision. If you take anything home about the <abbr title='Cyber Training Exercise'>CTX</abbr> Project, it is meant to be "real" as in true to the real world; "tangible" as in something the cadets can physically engage with (ie. not just mental games); and "engaging" in that it grabs your attention, holds it, and excites you about the 17X career fields.


> ## *To provide i5 cadets a real, tangible, and engaging view of the 17X career fields and how they operate and interoperate within the Space Force.*


## Who is the target audience?

This project is being spearheaded through i5, however it is not relegated exclusively towards i5 usage. The Space Force, like all military branches, is designed to operate not only with the other branches, but also with foreign partners. With this in mind, the <abbr title='Cyber Training Exercise'>CTX</abbr> Project is geared towards providing a comprehensive vision to i5 cadets and our partners.

> ROTC cadets are the target audience; particularly, those who are interested in space and cyber.

## What is i5's role in this project?
