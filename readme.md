## Intro to CTXs

CTX is designed to bring the intersection of Cyber and Space to the i5 audience in a real, tangible, and engaging way. Additionally, it is primarily designed for cadets interested in the 17S and 17D career fields. As such, it REQUIRES technical skills in the cyberspace domain to administer and perform highly in every CTX.

> Please Note: Cyber Training Exercies REQUIRE technical skills in the cyberspace domain to administer and perform highly.

This project is being spearheaded through i5, however it is not relegated exclusively towards i5 usage. The Space Force, like all military branches, is designed to operate not only with the other branches, but also with foreign partners. With this in mind, the CTX Project is geared towards providing a comprehensive vision to i5 cadets and our partners.

To help navigate the growing list of terms in this project, please see [terms.md](terms.md) for a breakdown on what specific terms mean.

### Vision:

Think of this as the long term objective, the big picture idea for this project.


> ## *Pioneer the future of Space Force cadet training*


### Mission:

Think of this as the method for acheiving the vision. If you take anything home about the CTX Project, it is meant to be "real" as in true to the real world; "tangible" as in something the cadets can physically engage with (ie. not just mental games); and "engaging" in that it grabs your attention, holds it, and excites you about the 17X career fields.


> ## *To provide i5 cadets a real, tangible, and engaging view of the 17X career fields and how they operate and interoperate within the Space Force.*
