## Intro to CTXs

CTX is designed to bring the intersection of Cyber and Space to the i5 audience in a real, tangible, and engaging way.

This project is being spearheaded through i5, however it is not relegated exclusively towards i5 usage. The Space Force, like all military branches, is designed to operate with not only the other branches, but also with foreign partners. With this in mind, the CTX project is geared towards providing a comprehensive vision to i5 cadets and our partners.

### Vision:

Think of this as the long term objective, the big picture idea for this project.

> ## *Pioneer the future of Space Force ROTC training*


### Mission:

Think of this as the method for acheiving the vision.


> ## *To provide i5 cadets a real, tangible, and engaging view of the 17X career fields and how they operate and interoperate within the Space Force.*
